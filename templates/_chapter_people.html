In China in the 1980s, South Korea in the 1970s, America in the 1800s, and many other countries over the years, workers -- mostly women -- left subsistence farms to work in factories.</p>

                        <p>The factories can be brutal, dangerous places. In 1911, a fire at the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory in New York killed over 100 workers, prompting major reforms that improved working conditions. Earlier this year, more than 1,000 workers were killed when the Rana Plaza factory building in Bangladesh collapsed. Huge protests around the country followed, along with increasing global pressure on Bangladesh to improve working conditions and wages.</p>
                        <p>That pressure led the country to almost double its minimum wage, from $39 a month to $68 a month. Still, that’s far below the $104 a month the workers were asking for. (The workers who made the Planet Money T-shirt were making about $80 month when we were there earlier this year. Their wages are likely to rise, now that the minimum wage has gone up.)</p>

                        <p>Factory owners worry that if the minimum keeps going up, the garment industry will find someplace else to make T-shirts. That’s what’s happened for decades: When labor costs rose in one country, Western buyers found someplace cheaper, and prices for clothes continued to fall.</p>

                        <p class="promo-link">{{ COPY.people.related_korea_leadin }}: <a href="{{ COPY.people.related_korea_link }}" target="_blank">{{ COPY.people.related_korea_text }}</a></p>

                        <p>In the case of the Planet Money T-shirt, the buyer is Jockey. The company told us that the pattern of pulling out when wages rise may be coming to an end for now, because there’s no country that’s ready to replace Bangladesh as the cheapest place in the world to make clothes.</p>
                        <p>Wages in Bangladesh are going to rise, Marion Smith, a senior vice president at Jockey, told us. “That’s good news from a humanitarian point of view.”</p>

                        <p>But the long-run picture for Bangladeshi garment workers is less clear.</p>
                        <p>In China, South Korea and Japan, to name just a few countries, the textiles and apparel industry brought with it investment and manufacturing knowledge, which those countries used to expand into higher-wage industries like electronics. As economies grow and countries move into other, more lucrative industries, textiles and apparel become less important. But the same may not happen in Bangladesh.</p>

                        <p>Bangladesh stands out on the graph for a few reasons. For one, apparel exports make up a bigger share of Bangladesh’s exports than they ever did for any of the other countries. And that share is still rising. If the next generation of workers like Jasmine is to have more opportunities, that line needs to fall, and Bangladesh needs to expand into other industries.</p>
