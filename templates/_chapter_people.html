                        <p>The global garment industry is flocking to Bangladesh for a simple reason: It’s the cheapest place in the world to make clothes. The Bangladeshi workers who made the Planet Money men’s T-shirt make about $80 a month. Many workers in the country make even less: The minimum wage is just $39 a month.</p>

                        <p>These women are part of a global wave that goes all the way back to the industrial revolution in England, when the first textile factories were created. Since then, making yarn, or fabric, or clothes has been the first step toward industrialization for dozens of countries. In country after country, young women have left subsistence farms to work in textile factories.</p>
                        <p>Those women have often faced brutal, dangerous conditions. In 1911, a fire at the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory in New York killed over 100 workers, and prompted major reforms that improved working conditions. Last year, the Rana Plaza factory building in Bangladesh collapsed  and killed more than 1,000 workers, leading to huge protests around the country and increased global pressure on Bangladesh to improve working conditions. Any day now, the government is expected to announce a new, higher minimum wage.</p>

                        <p>Shumi and Minu Tk, two sisters who both worked on our shirt live in a one-room apartment along with Minu’s husband. Their water comes from a hose that snakes up from downstairs, into these two big barrels that they share with their neighbors.  They also share the two little gas burners in the hallway.  Shumi sleeps in the bed; Minu and her husband sleep on the floor. Their life feels close to the edge. You get the sense that if one of them lost their job, they might go hungry. Still, they say, life was even more difficult in the rural village where they grew up.</p>
                        <p>The main garment workers union is asking for the minimum wage to be raised to $105 a month -- still low by global standards, but roughly triple the current minimum. Factory owners say that if the minimum wage goes up to $105 a month, buyers from the developed world will pull up stakes and find someplace else to make T-shirts.</p>
                        <p>For decades now, global T-shirt companies have chased cheap labor from country to country.  As wages rose in one place buyers moved on, and the price of T-shirts in the developed world fell.</p>

                        <p>That era may be coming to an end, according to Marion Smith, a senior vice president at Jockey, the company that sold us the Planet Money T-shirt. Wages in China have doubled, and are likely to continue rising. Other low-wage countries are too small or don’t have the infrastructure in place to become the next tailor shop to the world, Smith says.</p>
                        <p>After Bangladesh, he says, there’s no obvious next place to go. “We’re getting down to the end of it,” Smith told us. “Bangladesh is going to go up, and who’s cheaper than Bangladesh?”</p>
                        <p>Pay for workers like Jasmine and Shumi makes a up just a tiny fraction of the finished cost of a T-shirt. That means that, if Smith is right and the global garment industry stays put in Bangladesh,  prices for T-shirts may rise a little in the U.S. -- and wages for workers like Shumi and Jasmine may go up a lot.</p>
