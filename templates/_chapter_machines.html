                        <p>We chased our bales of Mississippi cotton through the streets of Jakarta and out into the Indonesian countryside, where rice fields have been turned into Honda plants and satellite farms.</p>
                        <p>It's a busy, crowded place -- until you walk into the Indorama yarn factory. The building is a big as a football field, and there's almost no one there. It’s just row after row of shiny machines.</p>
                        <p>Today, yarn spinning is a high-tech, capital intensive business. It cost around $35 million to build the Indonesian factory where the cotton for the Planet Money men's T-shirt was spun into yarn. What you get for that money is a factory that can make yarn with incredible precision, 24 hours a day, 361 days a year. (They take four days off at the end of Ramadan.)</p>

                        <p>There are six miles of yarn in a single Planet Money T-shirt. If any of that yarn is too thick or too thin, even by a little bit, the T-shirt will warp or won't fit right. We bought the shirt from Jockey, which specified dozens of variables for Indorama -- the thickness of the yarn, how uniform it is, how strong it is, the way it’s twisted. Jockey wouldn't tell us exactly what those specs are.</p>
                        <p>"That's our special sauce," said Marion Smith, a senior vice president at Jockey. It's like the secret formula for Coke, but softer on the skin.</p>

                                    <p>Two words: compact ringspun. A machine sucked the fibers close together when the yarn for our shirt was spun, creating yarn that makes an extra-smooth shirt. The yarn has relatively few twists per inch, which makes the fabric soft and comfortable &mdash; but also more likely to pill.</p>

                                    <p>This is some big, hairy yarn. It's soft cushiony and absorbent, but also irregular in size and appearance.</p>

                        <p>Jockey’s recipe for the yarn may be a secret, but the Indonesian factory that made our yarn is using machines that anyone with enough money can buy. But Indonesia is in a sweet spot right in the middle of the global t-shirt trade. Wages are lower here than they are in developed countries. At the same time, unlike many countries where labor is even cheaper, Indonesia has a few key things that are essential for keeping a high-tech factory humming: an educated workforce; cheap, reliable electricity; and a relatively stable government.</p>
                        <p>But staying in the sweet spot in a global economy is almost impossible.  At some point, a country that has cheaper labor or is closer to where clothes are made will find the money, the electricity and the workers to build its own, big spinning plant. Anyone who can produce the same quality yarn for a few pennies cheaper will win.</p>
