                        <p>There are 6 miles of yarn in a single Planet Money T-shirt. If any of that yarn is too thick or too thin, even by a little bit, the T-shirt could start falling apart after just a few washes. (Yarn, by the way, is what ordinary people call thread. In the garment business, it&rsquo;s called yarn.)</p>
                        <p>Spinning yarn is high-tech and shockingly complex. The yarn for the Planet Money T-shirt had to meet dozens of specifications &mdash; thickness, tenacity, the amount of twist, the direction of the twist. <a href="http://www.talktextiles.com/nuke/Glossary/tabid/59/Default.aspx?topic=Breaking+Tenacity" target="_blank">Newtons per tex!</a></p>
                        <p>But even though we ordered thousands of shirts, our supplier, Jockey, wouldn&rsquo;t tell us exactly what those specs were. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s our special sauce,&rdquo; said Marion Smith, a senior vice president at Jockey. It&rsquo;s like the secret formula for Coke, but softer on the skin.</p>

                        <p>The Planet Money men&rsquo;s T-shirt was spun into yarn at a $35 million factory in Indonesia. What you get for that money is a factory that can make yarn with incredible precision and consistency, 24 hours a day, 361 days a year. (It takes four days off at the end of Ramadan.)</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;When I see people just picking up a T-shirt and putting it back on the shelf in a store,&rdquo; says Anupam Agrawal, who heads the spinning operation at the factory, &ldquo;I say, &lsquo;Hey, man. We worked very hard to make the yarn which has made that T-shirt. Give it some respect.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

                        <p>Jockey&rsquo;s recipe for the yarn may be a secret, but Agrawal&rsquo;s factory is using machines that anyone with enough money can buy. Right now, Indonesia is in a sweet spot in the middle of the global T-shirt trade. Wages are lower here than they are in developed countries. At the same time, unlike many countries where labor is even cheaper, Indonesia has a few key things that are essential for keeping a high-tech factory humming: an educated workforce; cheap, reliable electricity; and a relatively stable government.</p>
                        <p>But staying in the sweet spot in a global economy is almost impossible. At some point, a country that has cheaper labor or is closer to where clothes are made will find the money, the electricity and the workers to build its own spinning industry.</p>
