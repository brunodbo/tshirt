                        <h2>Three Reasons U.S. Cotton Is Still King</h2>
                        <p>You can grow cotton in places where land and labor are cheap. You can grow it in places that are close to the countries &mdash; Colombia, Indonesia, Bangladesh &mdash; where the Planet Money T-shirt was made. Yet most of the cotton in the Planet Money T-shirts was grown in the U.S. In fact, the U.S. exports more cotton than any country in the world. Here are three reasons why.</p>

                        <h3>Technology</h3>
                        <p>The U.S. has perfected cotton by treating it as a high-tech product.</p>

                                Notes:<br />
                                - Cotton yields are projections.<br />
                                - Flowers's farm also produces other crops. Some of the machinery and staff listed here also work elsewhere on the farm.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                        <p>Genetically modified crops are controversial, but not among U.S. cotton farmers: 90 percent of U.S. cotton comes from genetically modified seeds that were designed in labs to produce more cotton and resist pests.</p>
                        <p>And when it's time to harvest those seeds, U.S. farmers use, essentially, giant robots. Just last year, Bowen Flowers, the cotton farmer in the video, bought five John Deere 7760 pickers. Priced at over $600,000, these pickers are the size of tanks, but are finely-tuned, self-driving machines that feel the cotton plant stalks and twist off just the cotton puffs.</p>
                        <p>Like the seeds, the pickers get more productive every year as the technology improves. The newest John Deere picker needs just one guy to do what it took five guys to do a couple years ago. One driver can pick a hundred acres of cotton a day &mdash; and he barely needs to touch the steering wheel, because the machine largely drives itself.</p>
                        <p>Toto Latrell Jones, a cotton picker at Bowen Flowers’s farm, says the machine lets him pick more in a day than his grandfather could have picked in a lifetime.</p>

                        <h3>Report Cards</h3>
                        <p>Every year, the USDA tests all 17 million bales of cotton harvested in the U.S. The farmers pay for the testing, and the USDA figures out exactly how fine, long, strong and stretchy every bale of cotton is. Anyone, anywhere in the world can get a report card that tells them everything they need to know about every bale of U.S. cotton.</p>
                        <p>Here are a few key specs for a sample from Bowen Flowers’s crop.</p>

                        <p>To understand how this keeps American cotton on top, it helps to travel 10,000  miles to Indonesia, where our cotton was spun into yarn for the men’s T-shirt. (And by yarn we mean thread. In the clothing business, people call it yarn.)</p>
                        <p>A factory manager there told us  that, when he orders U.S. cotton, he knows exactly what he’s getting before he ever sees or touches the cotton. The spinners have a special recipe for their yarn, and they need exactly the right cotton &mdash; exactly the right color, exactly the right length, exactly the right fineness. No surprises.</p>
                        <p>The USDA testing means a cotton buyer in Indonesia can order a bale of U.S. cotton that's guaranteed to match his exact specifications, every time.</p>

                        <h3>Subsidies</h3>
                        <p>U.S. cotton farmers benefit from a bunch of government subsidy programs. (Other countries subsidize their cotton farmers as well, by the way.) The government gives taxpayer money directly to cotton farmers, and subsidizes insurance that protects farmers if their harvest is weak or cotton prices fall.</p>

                                <dd>The government subsidizes several kinds of insurance available to cotton farmers. One popular option is revenue insurance, which pays farmers if they make less money than they expect. This can happen for a few reasons &mdash; cotton prices may fall, or a farmer may have a bad harvest. The government pays a big chunk of the premiums for the farmers &mdash; and also pays the operating costs of the companies that sell the insurance.</dd>

                                <dd>Through the “countercyclical program,” the federal government pays cotton farmers when the average price of cotton falls below a certain level. The level is based on average prices over the past few years. Cotton prices have been rising recently, so the government hasn’t been making payments via this program.</dd>

                                <dd>If you grew cotton on your farm in the 1990s, you get a cash payment from the government &mdash; even if you don’t grow cotton on your farm anymore, and even if cotton prices are going through the roof.

                        <h2>Why The Recipe For Our Yarn Is Like The Secret Formula For Coke</h2>
                        <p>There are six miles of yarn in a single Planet Money T-shirt. If any of that yarn is too thick or too thin, even by a little bit, the T-shirt will warp or won't fit right.  (Yarn, by the way, is what ordinary people call thread. In the garment business, it’s called yarn.)</p>
                        <p>Spinning yarn is high-tech and shockingly complex. The yarn for the Planet Money T-shirt had to meet dozens of specifications &mdash; thickness, tenacity, the amount of twist, the direction of the twist. Newtons per tex!</p>
                        <p>But even though we we ordered thousands of shirts, our supplier, Jockey, wouldn't tell us exactly what those specs were. "That's our special sauce," said Marion Smith, a senior vice president at Jockey. It's like the secret formula for Coke, but softer on the skin.</p>

                                    <p>Two words: compact ringspun. A machine sucked the fibers close together when the yarn for our shirt was spun, creating yarn that makes an extra-smooth shirt. The yarn has relatively few twists per inch, which makes the fabric soft and comfortable &mdash; but also more likely to pill.</p>

                        <p>The Planet Money men's T-shirt was spun into yarn at a $35 million factory in Indonesia. What you get for that money is a factory that can make yarn with incredible precision and consistency, 24 hours a day, 361 days a year. (They take four days off at the end of Ramadan.)</p>
                        <p>“When I see people just picking up a T-shirt and putting it back on the shelf in a store,” says Anupam Ahgrahwall, who oversees spinning at the factyory, “I say, ‘Hey, man. We worked very hard to make the yarn which has made that T-shirt. Give it some respect.’”</p>
                        <p>Jockey’s recipe for the yarn may be a secret, but the Indonesian factory that made our yarn is using machines that anyone with enough money can buy. Right now, Indonesia is in a sweet spot right in the middle of the global t-shirt trade. Wages are lower here than they are in developed countries. At the same time, unlike many countries where labor is even cheaper, Indonesia has a few key things that are essential for keeping a high-tech factory humming: an educated workforce; cheap, reliable electricity; and a relatively stable government.</p>
                        <p>But staying in the sweet spot in a global economy is almost impossible.  At some point, a country that has cheaper labor or is closer to where clothes are made will find the money, the electricity and the workers to build its own, big spinning plant. Anyone who can produce the same quality yarn for a few pennies cheaper will win.</p>

                        <p>Shumi and Minu are sisters who, like Jasmine, worked on our shirt. They live in this room with Minu’s husband, NAME TK. There’s a TV in the corner that Minu bought with her own money. She’s so proud that she couldn’t bear to throw away the box the TV came in, so it sits on a shelf, taking up valuable space. Shumi manages to save $6 a month, which she hopes will pay for her wedding someday.</p>

                        <p class="promo-link">READ MORE: <a href="" target="_blank">Shumi, Minu And The Trade-Offs Of Factory Life In Bangladesh</a></p>

                        <p>Like Jasmine &mdash; and like millions of other Bangladeshi women &mdash; Shumi and Minu left abject poverty in a rural village to work in a factory. Now they can send money home. Their younger siblings can go to school. Their family doesn’t go hungry anymore.</p>
                        <p>But there’s not much room in this life for any mistakes; if either of the sisters lost her job, the family could quickly go back to not having enough to eat. And, of course, it’s still a life of deprivation. Minu and her husband sleep on the floor. The apartment has no running water, no kitchen.</p>
                        <p>The global garment industry is flocking to Bangladesh for a simple reason: It’s the cheapest place in the world to make clothes. Shumi and Minu and Jasmine make about $80 a month. Many workers in the country make even less: The minimum wage is just $39 a month.</p>

                        <p>In 1911, a fire at the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory in New York killed over 100 workers, and prompted major reforms that improved working conditions. Last year, the Rana Plaza factory building in Bangladesh collapsed  and killed more than 1,000 workers, leading to huge protests around the country and increased global pressure on Bangladesh to improve working conditions. Any day now, the government is expected to announce a new, higher minimum wage.</p>
                        <p>The main garment workers union is asking for the minimum wage to be raised to $105 a month &mdash; still low by global standards, but roughly triple the current minimum. Factory owners say that if the minimum wage goes up to $105 a month, buyers from the developed world will pull up stakes and find someplace else to make T-shirts. But the factory owners may be wrong.</p>

                        <p>In the case of the Planet Money T-shirt, the buyer is us &mdash; at least, it’s Jockey, the company that sold us our t-shirt. Jockey told us that the garment industry’s decades-long chase for cheaper wages may be coming to an end.</p>
                        <p>“Bangladesh is going to go up, and who’s cheaper than Bangladesh?” Smith told us. “And that’s good news from a humanitarian point of view.”</p>
                        <p>Pay for workers like Jasmine and Shumi and Minu makes a up just a tiny fraction of the finished cost of a T-shirt. That means that, if Smith is right and the global garment industry stays put in Bangladesh, prices for T-shirts may rise a little in the U.S. &mdash; and wages for workers like Shumi, Minu and Jasmine may go up a lot.</p>

                        <p>The Planet Money men’s T-shirt traveled around the world on its way to you.  The cotton was grown largely in the U.S., spun into yarn in Indonesia, and sewn into shirts Bangladesh. Then a ship took the shirts back to the U.S., bound for a printing factory in Brooklyn. The Planet Money women’s shirt was made in Colombia, from cotton grown in the U.S.</p>
                        <p>All this travel was made affordable by one simple innovation: the shipping container.</p>

                        <p>Big metal boxes might not seem like an innovation. But without the humble container, the global economy wouldn’t be nearly as global as it is -- and the Planet Money T-shirt wouldn’t have been made the way it was.</p>
                        <p>Before containers, it was common for a single ship to be loaded with more than 100,000 different things -- bananas, fish meal, steel pipes -- all stuffed into sacks and boxes of different sizes. Workers had to pack each bag and box into the ship individually. Even with 50 or 100 people working, it could take weeks to unload and reload a single ship.</p>
                        <p>Malcolm Mclean, who led the move to containers, had no experiencewith ships at all. Mclean owned a trucking company back in the 1950s, before the Interstate highway system was built. It took forever for his trucks to get through traffic up and down the east coast.</p>
                        <p>Mclean had an idea: What if he put his trucks onto the ship in New York, and sailed them down the coast to North Carolina? He could hop over all that traffic! McLean eventually gave up on the idea of driving entire trucks onto boats and moved on to something that in the end makes a lot more sense. A truck is basically an engine attached to a box - so McLean made the box detachable.</p>
                        <p>Cranes could move the boxes from the trucks to the ship in New York. Cranes could put the boxes back on trucks in North Carolina. Not only would he skip traffic; it would make it profoundly easier to load and unload ships than it was before. (For much more on this story, see <a href="http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9383.html" target="_blank">The Box</a>, by Marc Levinson.)</p>
                        <p>Longshoremen fought containers for years: They saw that, with cranes and standardized containers, the number of people needed to load and unload ships would plummet. In the end, shipping companies agreed to pay into funds that would compensate workers who lost their jobs.</p>
                        <p>Standardized containers took off around the world, and by the mid 1960’s Malcolm Mclean -- the guy who dreamed of putting trucks on boats to avoid traffic -- had put together a fleet of container ships making international trips.</p>
                        <p>The age of containers had begun, and it greatly reduced the cost of shipping.  A global distribution system emerged around standardized boxes that could be easily moved from ships, to, trains to trucks.</p>
                        <p>Super cheap transport was a key reason that apparel companies went from making clothes in one place to managing of global supply chains -- so that, for example, a single T-shirt might start as U.S. cotton, then travel to Indonesia, Bangladesh and back to the U.S., all for far less than a dollar.</p>

                        <h2>How We Did This</h2>
                        <p>The idea seemed so simple: Let’s make a T-shirt, report on every facet of its creation, and sell the final product to our listeners.</p>
                        <p>The simplest shirt is touched by people and machines all over the planet &mdash; from highly paid researchers in seed laboratories to factory workers who earn a few dollars a day. By making our own t-shirt, we figured, we would discover this massive, interconnected, largely hidden world.</p>
                        <p>At first, we tried to go it alone. We went to Texas looking for a few bales of cotton. That went fine. But when we visited the North Carolina mills where cotton is spun into yarn, we got laughed out of the room. We were way too small; no one spins a few bales at a time. Our approach, we realized, was a little like deciding to make a laptop from scratch, and starting by mining our own copper.</p>
                        <p>Eventually, we sought the advice of experts. Marion Smith, the director of global sourcing for Jockey, the underwear company, was patient with us on the phone. He gently corrected our mistakes. (T-shirts are knitted, not woven. They’re made from something that looks like thread, but is called yarn.) Eventually, Jockey agreed to sell us T-shirts &mdash; and, more importantly, to let us follow the creation of those shirts.</p>
                        <p>The Planet Money T-shirts are made of fabric that Jockey’s textile experts developed. They’re based on a design pattern Jockey uses for its own t-shirt line. Jockey introduced us to their suppliers in Bangladesh and Colombia, and those suppliers agreed to assemble our shirts. And Jockey designers helped us pick out the colors for our shirts.</p>
                        <p>The design on the shirt, a squirrel hoisting a martini glass, is a visual pun: a reference to the phrase "animal spirits" made famous by the economist John Maynard Keynes. As Planet Money's David Kestenbaum <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2013/04/30/180079862/episode-455-the-planet-money-t-shirt-is-finally-almost-here" target="_blank">put it recently</a>: "Keynes's idea was that there's more to the markets than just numbers, there are people and emotions making decisions. And to the extent that we are finding the human element in the very dry subject of economics, it's actually perfect for us."</p>
                        <p>To figure out how many shirts to make, and to raise money to pay for them, we turned to <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/planetmoney/planet-money-t-shirt" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>. We promised T-shirts to everyone who pledged $25. Our goal was to raise enough money for 2,000 shirts. In the end, we raised enough for 25,000. (Thanks again to everyone who ordered a shirt. Really. Amazing.)</p>
                        <p>On TK, 2013, we placed our order: TK men’s shirts, TK women’s shirts. And then we <a href="http://seedtoshirt.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">went all over the world to report</a> on our shirt’s construction.</p>

In fact, we hired the author, Pietra Rivoli, to be an advisor on this project. And the original idea for this project came, more than three years ago, from Planet Money co-founder Adam Davidson.</p>
